Chicago LUG Builds Tor Relays

The Chicago Linux Users Group has been recently discussing a variety
of security-related topics including Tor, running your own OpenVPN,
and GPG. As proponents of free and open source software as well as
supporters of an open Internet we felt it was important to support
projects like Tor. Thanks to resources donated by Rackspace, we
are able to run a relatively fast, stable Tor middle relay.

The full slide of the presentation of the presentation can be
found on our mediagoblin install of the Chicago Linux users group. It 
is also included in the repository as TorTalk.odp

Below we'll share some quick documenation, some problems (and
solutions) we ran into and a full configuration file you can use for
your own Tor relays. It is included in the repository as torrc.tct
Remember, the Tor network is only as fast as the relays that support it. 
Also, the more people who use Tor, the better anonymity it provides 
for everyone whom uses Tor.

We build an Ubuntu server using a Rackspace VPS and the goal was to
build two relays on the server using configuration management using
Ansible. (More on that later). First we installed Tor and configured
it using the below steps. (note: always use the latest documentation
from TorProject.org [5]). First we edited the sources.list

           sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list

and added the below line

	deb     http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org
	<DISTRIBUTION> main

Note: It is NOT recommended to run unsigned code, you should always
verify the author of these repositories. This is why its great to have
GPG signed packages (You are using GPG right?)

             gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv 886DDD89
             gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 |
sudo apt-key add

Then we grab the latest Tor packages

             sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

and finally we install a repository to manage these GPG keys and
install the Tor packages and a command line tool.

              sudo apt-get install deb.torproject.org-keyring
              sudo apt-get install tor arm-cli

To actually edit the tor relay, find and edit the /etc/tor/torrc 
and make it look something like this: [Example Tor Config]
